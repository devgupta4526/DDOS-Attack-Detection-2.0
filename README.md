# Effective DDoS Attack Detection Using Statistical and ML Methods

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using statistical and machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on developing methods to accurately detect DDoS attacks and mitigate their effects in real-time.



**Title:** Effective DDoS Attack Detection Using Statistical and ML Methods

## Project Objectives

1. **Effective Detection and Mitigation:**
   - Develop a system to continuously monitor network traffic and provide timely alerts for DDoS attacks.

2. **Adaptability to Evolving Attack Patterns:**
   - Create detection models that can adapt to new DDoS attack techniques.

3. **Scalability and Resource Optimization:**
   - Implement techniques to reduce the impact of DDoS attacks and optimize resource utilization during an attack.

## Tech Stack

- **Methods Used:**
  - **Entropy Analysis:** Detect DDoS attacks using entropy measures.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Classification and regression tasks for DDoS detection.
  - **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:** Time series analysis for detecting stationarity.
  - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Live traffic analysis for DDoS detection.

## Implementation Path

1. **Entropy Analysis:** Calculate entropy to detect deviations from normal behavior.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Use different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) for accurate classification.
3. **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:** Assess stationarity of time series data.
4. **ANN Integration:** Combine ADF and entropy results for real-time detection.

## Advantages of the Proposed Methodology

- **Capture of Time Series Dynamics:** Identify both short-term and long-term traffic patterns.
- **Enhanced Statistical Significance:** Reduce false positives by distinguishing between random fluctuations and meaningful deviations.
- **Adaptability:** Continuously update the reference model to adapt to changing traffic patterns.

## Results

- **Plain Entropy:** Accuracy: 92%
- **Entropy with ADF Test:** Accuracy: 97%

## Extension: DDoS Mitigation in Cloud

### Factors Contributing to DDoS Attacks in Cloud Environments

1. **Resource Abundance**
2. **Masking Attack Origins**
3. **Botnets and Malware**
4. **Lack of DDoS Mitigation**

### Types of DDoS Attacks in Cloud Computing

1. **SYN Flood Attack**
2. **UDP Flood Attack**
3. **HTTP Flood Attack**

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Behavioral Analysis:** Identify abnormal patterns in data transmission.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent prolonged resource consumption.
- **Connection Timeouts:** Manage connections effectively.

## Detection Challenges

- **In-Depth Monitoring:** Required to identify abnormal traffic patterns.
- **Behavioral Modeling:** Accurate modeling of cloud user behaviors.
- **Scalable Defense Mechanisms:** Adapt to evolving attack strategies.
